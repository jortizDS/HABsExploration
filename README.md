## Overview
This project is a Python script that uses the `dataretrieval` package to access and explore historical chlorophyll a water quality data at the Illinois River at Starved Rock, IL monitoring site. The script demonstrates how to connect to the USGS NWIS web services, retrieve parameter-specific data, and perform initial filtering and analysis.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to:

- Connect to the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) using the dataretrieval package.

- Identify the correct site and parameter code for chlorophyll a.

- Download time series data and perform basic exploration.

Provide a foundation for visualizing or analyzing chlorophyll a trends at Starved Rock.

## Data Source
USGS NWIS (National Water Information System) via `dataretrieval` Python package.

## Tools Used
- Python 

- dataretrieval package

- pandas for data manipulation

- matplotlib or seaborn (optional, for plotting)
